# Project Overview
* This project aims to predict the severity of road traffic accidents using data collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments. The dataset covers road traffic accidents from 2017-2020 and has been used to identify the major causes of accidents by analyzing it with various machine learning classification algorithms.

# Dataset
* Source: Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments
* Description: The dataset was prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents from 2017-2020. All sensitive information was excluded during data encoding.
* Features: 32 features
* Instances: 12,316 instances
* Target Feature: Accident_severity (multi-class variable)

# Objective
* To classify the accident severity based on 31 features, using step-by-step machine learning techniques, with the f1-score as the evaluation metric.

# Approach
* Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to gain deeper insights into the target variable and form data-driven hypotheses.
* Feature Engineering:

Implemented feature selection and engineering techniques to enhance the model's predictive power.
* Model Development:

Built and fine-tuned classification models using XGBoost, Random Forest, and Extra Trees Classifier.
* Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using the f1-score.
# Results
* Best Model: Extra Trees Classifier
* Accuracy: Achieved a best-in-class accuracy score of 88%

# Deployment
* Platform: Streamlit
* Functionality: Deployed the optimized model on an interactive website, enabling users to input data and receive real-time predictions.
# Conclusion
* The developed machine learning model effectively predicts accident severity, addressing a critical safety concern with a robust and reliable model achieving an 88% accuracy score.
